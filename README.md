# scTECH-seq EMT

This document contains the code explaining how to perform the bioinformatics analysis used in Metastable Intermediates Identified in Human Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition are Regulated by G-quadruplex DNA Structures. 

A single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in human mammary epithelial cells, utilising a novel cell hashing method (scTECH-seq). Transcriptional and cellular heterogeneity in this process leads to multiple metastable hybrid E/M states. DNA G-quadruplex structures play can be targeted to regulate expression of EMT regulating genes.
