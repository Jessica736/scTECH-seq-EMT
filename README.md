# scTECH-seq EMT

This document contains the code explaining how to perform the bioinformatics analysis used in Metastable Intermediates Identified in Human Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition are Regulated by G-quadruplex DNA Structures. 

A single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in human mammary epithelial cells, utilising a novel cell hashing method (scTECH-seq). Transcriptional and cellular heterogeneity in this process leads to multiple metastable hybrid E/M states. DNA G-quadruplex structures play can be targeted to regulate expression of EMT regulating genes. 

The R code to deconvolute single cells tagged with SBOs back to their original assignment is available at https://github.com/genomicswa/d-score.
